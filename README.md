## Introduction

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to classify product reviews into predefined categories. This can be used for sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and enhancing customer service.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mariamAboujenane/product-review-classification.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd product-review-classification
    ```


## Usage

To use the classification model:

1. Ensure that you have the necessary data in the correct format.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `product_review_classification.ipynb` to train and evaluate the model.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `product_review_classification.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project.
